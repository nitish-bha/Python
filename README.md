-Define Data Structures
It is nothing but way of organizing the data, so it can be easily accessed  efficiently depending upon the situation. These are fundamentals of any programming language.
-what is algorithm?
Algorithm is set of instructions to solve a program.

Linear data structures- Stores the data in a sequential manner

Array -  sequential data element paired with index of the data element.

Linked List - Each data element is linked with another element along with the data present in it.

Stack - It is a  data structure which follows FILO (First in last out) or LIFO(Lat in First out)


Queue - This data structure is similar to stack but it only follows First IN First out

Matrix - It is 2 dimensional data structure in which data element is referred by pair of indices.

Non - Linear Data Structures: In this data cannot be stored in a sequential way and also any pair or group  can be linked to each other and can be accessed without a strict sequence.

Binary Tree - It is a data structure where each data element can be connected to max two other data elements and it starts with a root node.

Heap - It is a data structure which made of arrays associated with each other using hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather than index values

Graph - It is connection of vertices and nodes where some of the nodes are connected to each other through links.



Detailed Explanation on Arrays:

Array is a container which can hold fix number of items and should be with same datatype. Most of the data structures make use of arrays  to implement their algorithms.

there are 2 important terms:

Element - Each item stored in an array is called an element.
Index - Each location of an element in an array has a numerical index, which is used to identify the element.

Basic operations:
Traverse − print all the array elements one by one.

Insertion − Adds an element at the given index.

Deletion − Deletes an element at the given index.

Search − Searches an element using the given index or by the value.

Update − Updates an element at the given index.

Syntax-
from array import *
arrayName = array(typecode, [Initializers])
