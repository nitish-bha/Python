#How Algorithm Works: Algorithm is a set of instructions to solve a problem.
#Defining or adding two numbers
num1 = 2
num2 = 7
sum = num1 + num2
print(sum)

#Finding largest numbers among the three

a=2;b=3;c=7;
print(a,b,c)
if a > b:
    if a > c:
        print("a is the largest")
    else:
        print("c is the largest")
else:
    if b > c:
        print("b is the largest")
    else:
        print('c is the largest')
